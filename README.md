# OpenCV-Pillow-Tesseract-Project
Take a ZIP file of images and process them, using a library built into python. Using python,  search through the images looking for the occurrences of keywords and faces. Use OpenCV to detect faces, use tesseract to do optical character recognition, and  use PIL to composite images together into contact sheets.
